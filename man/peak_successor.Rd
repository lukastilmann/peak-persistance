\title{Track Peak Succession Between Curves}
\usage{
peak_successor(peaks_1, valleys_1, peaks_2, labels_1, label_max, t_grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks_1}{Numeric vector of peak locations in the first curve}

\item{valleys_1}{Numeric vector of valley locations in the first curve}

\item{peaks_2}{Numeric vector of peak locations in the second curve}

\item{labels_1}{Numeric vector of labels for peaks in the first curve}

\item{label_max}{Numeric value indicating the current maximum label used}

\item{t_grid}{Numeric vector representing the time grid for the functional data}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item labels: Numeric vector of labels for peaks in the second curve
\item label_max: Updated maximum label value
}
}
\description{
Identifies which peaks in a second curve correspond to peaks in a first curve,
maintaining consistent labeling across different lambda values.
}
\details{
The function tracks peaks across different curves by determining if peaks in the
second curve fall within the range defined by valleys surrounding peaks in the first curve.
